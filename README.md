- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for UI enhancements)
- **Testing**: RSpec, Cucumber (TDD approach)
- **Deployment**: Heroku

## 🏗 How I Built It
This project was developed using a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach. I utilized **RSpec** for unit testing and **Cucumber** for behavior-driven development (BDD). The process involved:
- Writing failing tests first.
- Implementing game logic to pass those tests.
- Using Sinatra to expose the functionality as a web app.
- Refining the UI for a seamless experience.
- Deploying and managing the app on Heroku.

Through this experience, I gained a deeper understanding of TDD, RESTful thinking, and the integration of SaaS concepts in a Ruby environment.
